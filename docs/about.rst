About Malva
===========

Overview
--------

Malva is a genomic search platform that provides access to harmonized single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. The platform enables researchers to search across thousands of samples for gene expression patterns, sequences, and biological signatures.

Key Features
------------

**Large Scale Data Access**
   Access to over 7,000 single-cell samples across diverse tissues and conditions.

**Real-time Search**
   Instantaneous results without reprocessing raw data.

**Multiple Query Types**
   Support for gene symbols, natural language queries, and DNA sequences.

**Harmonized Metadata**
   Standardized metadata across studies for consistent analysis.

Use Cases
---------

- Gene expression analysis across studies
- Biomarker discovery and validation
- Cell type characterization
- Disease signature identification
- Comparative genomics research

Data Sources
------------

Malva integrates data from:

- Human Cell Atlas datasets
- Published single-cell studies  
- Spatial transcriptomics experiments
- Disease-focused research cohorts

All data is processed through standardized pipelines with consistent quality control and metadata annotation.
